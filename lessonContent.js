        Variables have names, types, and values.<br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name</b>: a variable's name is what it is called in your code and how it is used</li>
            <li><b>Type</b>: a variable's type is the type of data it stores. Variables can store different types like numbers and words</li>
            <li><b>Value</b>: a variable's value is its data that it represents.</li>
        </ul>

        Some different variable types are:<br>
        <ul>
            <li><code>int</code> is used for whole numbers.</li>
            <li><code>float</code> is used for decimals.</li>
            <li><code>str</code> is used for text (strings).</li>
            <li><code>bool</code> is used for True or False.</li>
        </ul>

        To make or update a variable in python, we use assignment statements. It looks like this:<br>
        <code>variable_name = "any value"</code><br><br>
        Investigate and experiment with the code below. Try making your own variables and modifying existing ones!`,

        header: `You can ask the user questions using the <code>input()</code> function. It always gives you a <b>string</b>, even if the user types a number.<br><br>
    To do math or comparisons, you‚Äôll need to convert the input to another type like <code>int</code> (for whole numbers) or <code>float</code> (for decimals).<br><br>
    To do this, we use functions like <code>int()</code> or <code>float()</code>. See the code below to see how they work!<br><br>
    Read through the given code below. Try running this code, then experiment by entering your own name and age.<br>
    Then change it to ask for your favorite number, convert it to an <code>int</code>, and multiply it!`,

        <li><code>**</code> : Exponentiation (power)</li>
    </ul>    
    <b>Order of operations</b> follows PEMDAS: parentheses first, then exponents, multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction.<br><br>

        <li><code>*</code> : Repeats a string multiple times. Can only be used with a string and an integer.</li>
    </ul>
    You can‚Äôt directly add a number to a string, you‚Äôll need to convert the number using <code>str()</code> first.<br><br>
    Try experimenting with combining strings and numbers and the different operations. Read through the code and investigate if anything confuses you!`,

first = "Hello"
second = "world"

        <li><code>#</code> : Single-line comment</li>
        <li>Triple quotes (<code>'''</code> or <code>"""</code>) : Multi-line comment</li>

Python actually sees this as a multi-line string,

    If something is <code>True</code>, Python will run the code inside the <code>if</code> block.<br><br>
    You can also use <code>if/else</code> to run one thing if it's <code>True</code>, and something else if it's <code>False</code>.<br><br>
    In this lesson, we‚Äôll use <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> directly. We‚Äôll learn how to test conditions later!<br>
    Read the code below. Look at each <code>if</code> statement, and try to find which lines are part of the block and will be run. Try changing the boolean values and see how the output changes.`,

    But because of how computers store these numbers, sometimes math with decimals is a little bit off.<br><br>
    For example, you'd expect <code>0.0037 == 0.37 / 100</code> to be <code>True</code>, but it‚Äôs actually <code>False</code> because of tiny rounding errors inside the computer.<br><br>
    To fix this, you can use the <code>round()</code> function to round numbers to a certain number of decimal places before comparing them.`,

        code: `# Floating point math looks normal at first
a = 0.3
b = 0.1+0.2

print("a:", a)

        header: `A <code>for</code> loop runs a block of code a certain number of times. It's perfect when you know how many times you want to repeat something!<br><br>
    <b>range()</b> is used to generate a list of numbers to loop through. You can give it either 1, 2, or 3 numbers. It works like this:
