    "Printing in Python":{
        header:`This is an example python program that prints to the console.<br>Notice how each print statement makes a new line on the console.<br>Experiment with removing parentheses, quotation marks, and adding new lines.<br>Finally, print three fun facts about yourself to the console, each on a different line.`,
        code:`print("hello world!")\nprint("this is a second line!")`
    },
    "Variables and Types": {
        header: `Variables are like labeled boxes that store information.<br>
        Variables have names, types, and values.<br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name</b>: a variable's name is what it is called in your code and how it is used</li>
            <li><b>Type</b>: a variable's type is the type of data it stores. Variables can store different types like numbers and words</li>
            <li><b>Value</b>: a variable's value is its data that it represents.</li>
        </ul>

        Some different variable types are:<br>
        <ul>
            <li><code>int</code> is used for whole numbers.</li>
            <li><code>float</code> is used for decimals.</li>
            <li><code>str</code> is used for text (strings).</li>
            <li><code>bool</code> is used for True or False.</li>
        </ul>

        To make or update a variable in python, we use assignment statements. It looks like this:<br>
        <code>variable_name = "any value"</code><br><br>
        Investigate and experiment with the code below. Try making your own variables and modifying existing ones!`,
        code: `# This is a comment. Python ignores comments.\n# Let's create some variables!\n\nname = "Alice"         # a string\nage = 13               # an integer\nheight = 5.3           # a float\nlikes_python = True    # a boolean\n\n# Let's print them!\nprint("Name:", name)\nprint("Age:", age)\nprint("Height:", height)\nprint("Likes Python:", likes_python)`
    },
    
    "User Input":{
        header: `You can ask the user questions using the <code>input()</code> function. It always gives you a <b>string</b>, even if the user types a number.<br><br>
    To do math or comparisons, you‚Äôll need to convert the input to another type like <code>int</code> (for whole numbers) or <code>float</code> (for decimals).<br><br>
    To do this, we use functions like <code>int()</code> or <code>float()</code>. See the code below to see how they work!<br><br>
    Read through the given code below. Try running this code, then experiment by entering your own name and age.<br>
    Then change it to ask for your favorite number, convert it to an <code>int</code>, and multiply it!`,

        code: `
# Ask the user for their name and age
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hi", name + "! You are", age, "years old.")

# Convert age to an integer so we can do math with it
age_number = int(age)
next_year = age_number + 1
print("Next year, you will be", next_year)

# Ask for a decimal number and convert it to float
height = float(input("How tall are you in feet? "))
print("You are", height, "feet tall!")`
    },

    "Math Operators":{
        header: `Python can do math just like a calculator! You can use numbers directly, or use variables to store them.<br><br>
    <b>Basic Operators:</b><br>
    <ul>
        <li><code>+</code> : Addition</li>
        <li><code>-</code> : Subtraction</li>
        <li><code>*</code> : Multiplication</li>
        <li><code>/</code> : Division (returns a float)</li>
        <li><code>//</code> : Integer Division (drops the decimal)</li>
        <li><code>%</code> : Modulo (remainder)</li>
        <li><code>**</code> : Exponentiation (power)</li>
    </ul>    
    <b>Order of operations</b> follows PEMDAS: parentheses first, then exponents, multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction.<br><br>
    Try changing the numbers and operators in the examples below. At the end, create your own math expression and see what it evaluates to!`,

        ode: `# Basic math operations
a = 10
b = 3

print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division (float):", a / b)

# Float example
c = 2.5
d = 4

print("My math expression result:", my_math)`
    },

    "String Operators":{
        header: `Strings are just text in Python, and you can combine or repeat them using operators!<br><br>
    <b>Useful string operators:</b>
    <ul>
        <li><code>+</code> : Concatenates (joins) two strings together. Can only be used with two strings.</li>
        <li><code>*</code> : Repeats a string multiple times. Can only be used with a string and an integer.</li>
    </ul>
    You can‚Äôt directly add a number to a string, you‚Äôll need to convert the number using <code>str()</code> first.<br><br>
    Try experimenting with combining strings and numbers and the different operations. Read through the code and investigate if anything confuses you!`,

        code: `# Concatenating strings
first = "Hello"
second = "world"
combined = first + " " + second
print(combined)

# Repeating strings
laugh = "ha"
print(laugh * 5)  # prints 'hahahahaha'

# Mixing strings and numbers (will cause an error!)
age = 13
# print("I am " + age + " years old")  # This will error!

# Convert the number to a string
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old")

# You can also build longer strings using variables
name = "Alice"
hobby = "drawing"
sentence = name + " likes " + hobby + "."
print(sentence)

# Try making your own!
emoji = "üêç"
print(emoji * 10)`
    },

    "Comments":{
        header: `Comments are notes in your code that Python ignores. They're super helpful for explaining what your code does.<br><br>
    <b>Types of comments:</b>
    <ul>
        <li><code>#</code> : Single-line comment</li>
        <li>Triple quotes (<code>'''</code> or <code>"""</code>) : Multi-line comment</li>
    </ul>
    Use comments to explain your thinking or remind yourself of what your code is doing. It makes your code easier to understand!`,

        code: `# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello")  # This prints a message

# You can also "turn off" code using a comment
# print("This won't run")

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It's useful for longer notes or explanations.
Python actually sees this as a multi-line string,
but if it's not assigned to anything, it works like a comment.
