            <li><b>Value</b>: a variable's value is its data that it represents.</li>

        Some different variable types are:<br>

    For example, you'd expect <code>0.0037 == 0.37 / 100</code> to be <code>True</code>, but it‚Äôs actually <code>False</code> because of tiny rounding errors inside the computer.<br><br>
    To fix this, you can use the <code>round()</code> function to round numbers to a certain number of decimal places before comparing them.`,

        header: `In Python, strings are like lists of characters. You can access individual characters using <b>indexing</b>.<br>
        Each character has a number called an <b>index</b> that tells you its position in the string, starting from 0.<br><br>
        You can use square brackets <code>[]</code> to get a character at a specific index.<br>
        The first character is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. Put the number inside the square brackets, after the string.<br><br>
        Example string with each index labeled:<br>
        <code>hello</code><br>
        <code>01234</code><br><br>
        If you try to access an index that is too high or too low, you‚Äôll get an <b>IndexError</b>.<br><br>
        Negative indexes count from the end of the string, with -1 being the last character.<br>
        Try running the code below and see how indexing works! Then, try accessing characters at different indexes.`,

        The <b>start</b> index is included, but the <b>end</b> index is not.<br><br>
        You can also use a third number called <b>step</b> to skip characters. The syntax is <code>string[start:end:step]</code>.<br>
        The <b>step</b> is how many characters to skip each time. It can also be negative.<br><br>
        If you leave out <b>start</b>, it defaults to 0. If you leave out <b>end</b>, it goes to the end of the string. If you leave out <b>step</b>, it defaults to 1.<br><br>
        Try running the code below and see how slicing works! Then, try slicing the string in different ways.`,
